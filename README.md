Programming Assignments in C Programming Language
==========

> **IMPORTANT**: Any student submitting the codes as their own is an act of plaigarism and 
is a violation of Washington State University's *"Student Honor's Code"*. The 
intention of me posting my programs is for collaboration and to hear 
feedbacks on possible improvements on the coding. This code repository also serves as my code portfolio and its purpose is for future employers to examine my coding skills. Please reference if you use part of the code and **DO NOT PLAGIARIZE**. *"Academic Dishonesty"* falls under the *Standards of Conduct for Students*.


Programming Assignments, is a collection of different C programs 
required to complete the Program Development & Design at Washington 
State University - Pullman Campus. The programs were coded by me, but the 
problems are provided by my instructor, Andrew O'Fallon.


Requirements
------
I am using Visual Studio 2010 and it should be an easy add project step. 
But if you don't have Visual Studio 2010, then you should be able to use
any ANSI standard C compiler to execute the programs.
