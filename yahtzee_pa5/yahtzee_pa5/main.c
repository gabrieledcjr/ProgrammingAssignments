 * Description: This program is a dice game called Yahtzee that was      *
 *              invented by Milton Bradley and Edwin S. Lowe in 1956.    *
 *              The challenge of the game is to outduel the other player *
 *              by scoring the most points. Points are obtained by       *
 *              rolling five 6-sided die across thirteen rounds. During  *
 *              each round, each player may roll the dice up to three    *
 *              times to make one of the possible scoring combinations.  *
 *              Once a combination has been achieved by the player, it   *
 *              may not be used again in future rounds, except for the   *
 *              Yahtzee combination may be used as many times as the     *
 *              player makes the combination. Each scoring combination   *
 *              has different point totals. Some of these totals are     *
 *              achieved through the accumulation of points across rolls *
 *              and some are obtained as fixed sequences of values.      *
